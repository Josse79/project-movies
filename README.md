# Project Movies

The assignement was to build a multi-page React route application using an API from themoviedb.org where we fetched a list of movies to display them on a main page and make each move a clickable link to its own detail page where you can find more information about the movie.

## The problem

We started by collecting the apikey and build the route pages.
By following the technigo lessons, searching on SO and google we fetched the API data into our pages step by step
Lastly we styled the app with css and adjusting it to be responsive using media queries.

If we had more time we would have tried to apply:
 - original size for the images incl. setLoading to get a better resolution and faster upload
 - 404 not found page
