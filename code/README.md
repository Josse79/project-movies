The assignement was to build a multi-page React application using an API from themoviedb.org where we fetched a list of movies to display them on a main page and make each move a clickable link to its own detail page where you can find more information about the movie.

We started by collecting the apikey.

Lastly we styled the app with css and adjusting it to be responsive using media queries.

# Technigo React Starter App

This app has been generated using `create-react-app`, then cleaned up a little so we have a project with just the elements we need to get started.

Add components in the `src` folder and use them in `src/app.js` to get started.
